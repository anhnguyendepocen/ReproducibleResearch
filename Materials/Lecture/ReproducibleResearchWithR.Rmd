## What is reproducible research?

In quantitative research, an analysis or project are considered to be **reproducible** if:

- *"the data and code used to make a finding are available and they are sufficient for an independent researcher to recreate the finding."* [Christopher Gandrud, *Reproducible Research with R and R Studio*](https://www.crcpress.com/Reproducible-Research-with-R-and-R-Studio/Gandrud/p/book/9781498715379)


That is becoming more and more important in science:

- as programming and scripting are becoming integral in most disciplines
- as the amount of data increases

## Reproducibility and software engineering

Core aspects of **software engineering** are:

- project design
- software **readibility**
- testing
- **versioning**

As programming becomes integral to research, similar necessities arise among scientists and data analyists.

## Reproducibility and "big data"

There has been a lot of discussions about **"big data"**...

- volume, velocity, variety, ...

Beyond the hype of the moment, as the **amount** and **complexity** of data increases

- the time required to replicate an analysis using point-and-click software becomes unsustainable
- room for error increases

Workflow management software (e.g., ArcGIS ModelBuilder) is one answer, reproducible research based on script languages like R is another.
